# BlaziumDev

**BlaziumDev** is the official development organization behind the **Blazium ecosystem**, focused on building real, production-grade blockchain infrastructure and developer tools.

This organization does **not** build demos, mock systems, or frontend-only projects.  
Everything under BlaziumDev is designed for **real-world usage**, **real users**, and **real value transfer**.

## 🚀 Projects

## 🧠 Philosophy

We build:
- Real systems, not demos
- Backend-verified logic, not frontend illusions
- Developer-first tooling, not closed platforms
- Transparent architectures, not black boxes

No mock data.  
No placeholder logic.  
No hidden magic.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- Node.js (primary SDK target)
- TON & Solana blockchain tooling
- Secure backend verification
- Database-agnostic architecture
- Optional ORM support (not required)

---

## 🔐 Security Principles

- Backend-only crypto operations
- Idempotent payment handling
- Double-spend protection
- Replay attack prevention
- No private keys exposed in SDKs
- No auto-approval of payments

Security is a **requirement**, not a feature.
